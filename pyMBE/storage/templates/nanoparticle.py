    Template defining a nanoparticle in the pyMBE database.

    Attributes:

            Fixed type identifier. Always "nanoparticle".

        name ('str'): 
            Unique name of the nanoparticle template.

            Name of the particle template used as the nanoparticle core.

        total_number_of_sites ('int'):
            Total number of grafting/interaction sites on the nanoparticle surface.
            The surface density is computed from this value and the core radius.

            Name of the particle template used for the primary site type.

        fraction_primary_sites ('float'):
            Fraction of all surface sites assigned to the primary site type.
            Expected range is typically between 0 and 1.

        number_of_patches_of_primary_sites ('int'):
            Number of surface patches that contain the primary site type.

        secondary_site_particle_name ('str | None'):
            Optional particle template name for a secondary site type.

        Compute various nanoparticle properties from template parameters.

        The method uses:
        - Core radius from the core particle template.

                Active pyMBE object with a populated template database and unit registry.
