class BondInstance(PMBBaseModel):
    """
    Instance representation of a bond between two particles.

    Attributes:
        pmb_type ('str'):
            Fixed identifier set to ``"bond"`` for all bond instances.

        bond_id ('int'):
            Unique non-negative integer identifying this bond instance.

        name ('str'):
            Name of the bond template from which this instance was created.

        particle_id1 ('int'):
            ID of the first particle involved in the bond.

        particle_id2 ('int'):
            ID of the second particle involved in the bond.

    Notes:
        - ``particle_id1`` and ``particle_id2`` must correspond to
          particle instance IDs already registered in the database.
        - This class does **not** store simulation engine–specific
          objects (e.g., Espresso bond handles). Those should be created
          by a runtime builder separate from the persistent database.
