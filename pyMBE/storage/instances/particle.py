class ParticleInstance(PMBBaseModel):
    """
    Concrete instance of a particle placed in the simulation.

    Attributes:
        pmb_type ('str'):
            Fixed string identifying this object as a particle instance. Always ``"particle"``.

        name ('str'):
            Name of the particle template from which this instance is derived.

        particle_id ('int'):
            Unique non-negative integer identifying the particle within the database. Assigned sequentially by the database manager.

        initial_state ('str'):
            Name of the particle state at creation time. 

        residue_id ('int' | 'None'):
            Optional identifier of the ``ResidueInstance`` this particle belongs to. Particles that are not part of a residue should  leave this field as ``None``.

        molecule_id ('int' | 'None'):
            Optional identifier of the ``MoleculeInstance`` this particle  belongs to. Particles not belonging to any molecule should keep this as ``None``.

        assembly_id ('int' | 'None'):
            Identifier of the super-parent assembly (e.g. hydrogel) to which this particle instance belongs. ``None`` indicates that the particle is not assigned to any assembly.

    Notes:
        - ``initial_state`` is stored as a plain string to ensure clean serialization and avoid engine-specific objects.
        - Connectivity, bonding, and spatial ordering are external to this class and handled by the database or simulation backend.
