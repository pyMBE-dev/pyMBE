## Authorship system
To warrant a co-author status, one should contribute in one of the following way:
- New methods and modules that extend the functionalies of the module.
- Bugfixes and code enhancements that improve the quality of the module.
- Development of tutorials and other documentation of the module.
- Scripts for samples on how to use pyMBE, for testing of the library or for handy tools to extend the features fo the library.
- Ideas on the software design and architecture. This includes ideas on improving the code quality, existing features of the module, adding new features and other conceptual contributions that have a significant impact on the development of pyMBE.

In the pyMBE community, we use a tier system to select how to reward our contributors: 

### Tier-0 
- Contributors of big features of pyMBE, including stand-alone modules or a set of several methods.
- Admins of pyMBE.
- Contributors whose ideas had a substantial impact on the carpentry of the library.

### Tier-1
- Occasional developers of individual methods for pyMBE.
- Contributors of bugfixes and small code enhancements.
- Contributors of single-purpose scripts and tutorials.

All tier contributors will be acknowledged as authors of the module in `AUTHORS.md`. 
Additionally, Tier-0 contributors will be acknowledged in the `CITATION.cff`.
New Tier-0 contributors will be included in the `CITATION.cff` file after the corresponding release of a new version of the software.

## How to contribute to pyMBE
Create a fork of the repository and submit your contribution in the form of a pull request.
Give your branch a short and meaningful name, and start your work from the most recent commit on the main branch.
Any new version of the code must reproduce all the data stored in `testsuite/data`.
Before pushing your code, run `make tests` to execute the full test suite,
`make pylint` to check for code issues, and `make docs` to confirm sphinx can build the user guide.
When rapidly prototyping code, run `make unit_tests` periodically to check for regressions.
All new code will be reviewed by at least one member of the pyMBE development team before being merged into the main branch to ensure that a functional version of the code is always available.
Class methods are sorted in alphabetical order.
We follow semantic versioning and keep a changelog.
