The scripts in this folder are designed to reproduce part of the data in Landsgesell et al. publication [^1], which we used to validate the setup of hydrogels of weak polyelectrolytes in pyMBE.
To reproduce the data, one simply needs to run the following script:
```sh
python3 run_simulations.py
```
Then, one can plot the data generated by the script and visually compare it with the original data from Landsgesell et al. publication [^1] using the following scripts:
- plot_P_vs_V.py: plots the pressure-volume curve, showcasing data from Fig. 3 in the original publication.
- plot_pH_vs_alpha.py: plots the degree of ionization vs pH curve, showcasing data from Fig. 4 in the original publication.
